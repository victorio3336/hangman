The Hangman Game Javascript From Scratch was developed using JavaScript, CSS and HTML,  One player picks a secret word, and the other player tries to guess it. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is up to the players, but completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of six wrong answers until the game ends. The first player to guess the correct answer thinks of the word for the next game.
